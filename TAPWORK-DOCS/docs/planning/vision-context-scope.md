# Vision, Context, and Scope

## Product Vision
The goal of this project is to design and implement a modular, realistic system for learning and practicing modern development technologies. The system simulates a real-world access control workflow through user registration, barcode generation, email notifications, and attendance tracking.

The primary vision is to offer a hands-on environment where development skills can be practiced in a professional, industry-aligned context, including:
- Backend API design
- Containerized deployments
- Service integration (database, email, scanning)
- Documentation standards
- Phase-based development

Although it is a personal learning project, it is intentionally documented and structured as if it were a production-oriented system.

## Project Context
This project simulates an enterprise access control system used for:

- Employee registration  
- Barcode-based identification  
- Entry/exit tracking  
- Basic reporting  

In a real environment, a system like this would be used by departments such as Human Resources, Security, and Front Desk Operations.

In this learning environment, the project is used to practice:
- Designing system architecture  
- Building REST APIs  
- Working with Kubernetes and containers  
- Integrating tools such as SMTP, PostgreSQL, and barcode libraries  
- Frontend scanning using a device camera  
- Deployment workflows (local and cloud-like environments)

This context allows the project to mimic professional standards while remaining suitable for individual development and experimentation.

## Project Scope

### Included in the Current Scope
- User registration
- Generation of unique barcodes
- Email notifications for new users
- API REST endpoints for core functionality
- Frontend page to scan barcodes using the device camera
- Attendance recording (check-in/check-out)
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
- Basic attendance reports

### Out of Scope (for now)
- Mobile application
- Real integration with corporate HR systems
- Advanced user roles and permissions
- Enterprise security standards (SSO, OAuth, Keycloak)
- Cloud-managed Kubernetes clusters (AKS, EKS, GKE)
- Full biometric hardware integration (optional for future phases)

## Purpose of This Documentation
This document establishes the foundational planning of the project, defining its intent, limits, and learning objectives.  
It serves as a reference for the system’s direction before diving into technical requirements and implementation.
